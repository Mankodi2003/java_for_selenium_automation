The Set interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store a collection of unique elements.

Unlike a List, a Set does not allow duplicates, and it does not preserve the order of elements (Unlike you use TreeSet ot LinkedHashSet).

=> Common classes that implements Set:

1) HashSet 
2) TreeSet
3) LinkedHashSet


=> Common Set Methods :-

1) add()
2) remove()
3) contains()
4) size()
5) clear()



=> Set vs. List :-

List :- Allows duplicates.
Set :- Does not allow duplicates.


List :- maintains order.
Set :- Does not guarantee order.


List :- Access by index.
Set :- No index-based access.
