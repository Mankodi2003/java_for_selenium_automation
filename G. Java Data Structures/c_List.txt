The List interface is part of the java collections framework and presents an ordered collection of elements.

We can access elements by their index, add duplicated, and maintain the insertion order.

Since List is an interface, you cannot create a List object directly.

Instead you can use a class that implements the List interface, such as : ArrayList, LinkedList.



=> Common List Methods :-

1) add()
2) get()
3) set()
4) remove()
5) size()



=> List vs. Array :-

Array : Fixed Size.
List : Dynamic Size.


Array : Faster performance for raw data.
List : More flexible and feature-rich.


Array : Not part of Collection Framework.
List : Part of Collection FrameWork.
