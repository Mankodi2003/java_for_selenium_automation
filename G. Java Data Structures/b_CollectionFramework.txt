All of Data Structures like ArrayList, HashSet and HashMap are part of something bigger - The Java collections Framework.

The Java Collection FrameWork provides a set of interfaces (like List, Set and Map) and a set of classes (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.) that implement those interfaces.

All of these are part of the java.util package.

 1) List (for order)                 :-               1) ArrayList
                                                      2) LinkedList               


 2) Set (for unique elements)        :-               1) HashSet
                                                      2) TreeSet
                                                      3) LinkedHashSet

                    
 3) Map  (for key-value pairs)       :-               1) HashMap
                                                      2) TreeMap
                                                      3) LinkedHashMap
