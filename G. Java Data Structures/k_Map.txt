The map interface is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, but values can be duplicated.

A Map is useful when you want to associate a key (like a name or ID) with a value (Like an age or description).

Use a Map when you want to associate values with unique keys, like storing iser IDs with names.

=> Common Map Methods :-

1) put()
2) get()
3) remove()
4) containsKey()
5) KeySet()



=> Map vs. Set vs. Map :-

List :- Duplicates Allowed
Set :- Duplicates not Allowed
Map :- in Keys = Duplicates Not Allowed, in values = Duplicates Allowed


List :- Doesn't store key-value pairs
Set :- Doesn't store key-value pairs
Map :- stores key-value pairs


List :- Maintains Order.
Set :-  Doesn't maintain Order(unless using TreeSet or LinkedHashSet)
Map :- Doesn't maintain Order(unless using TreeMap or LinkedHashMap)
