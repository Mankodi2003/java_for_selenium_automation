Operators are used to perform operations.

5 types of operators are there : 
1) Arithmetic Operators 
2) Assignment Operators
3) Comparison Operators
4) Logical Operators
5) Bitwise Operators



1. Arithmetic Operators : 

+ => addition
- => subtraction
* => multiplication
/ => division
% => modulus
++ => increment
-- => decrement



2. Assignment Operators :

= => Assignment operator (assigns value)
+= => Add and assign (adds right operand to left operand and assigns result)
-= => Subtract and assign
*= => Multiply and assign
/= => Divide and assign
%= => Modulo and assign (remainder and assign)
&= => Bitwise AND and assign
|= => Bitwise OR and assign
^= => Bitwise XOR and assign
>>= => Right shift and assign
<<= => Left shift and assign



4. Comparison Operators :

== => Equal to
!= => Not Equal
> => Greater than
< => Less than
>= => Greater than or equal to
<= => Less than or equal to



5. Logical Operators:

&& => Logical end
|| => Logical or
! => Logical Not
